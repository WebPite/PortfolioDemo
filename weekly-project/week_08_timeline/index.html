                <p>The first is inspired by the Frutiger Aero theme. Frutiger Aero is a design style that emerged in the early 2000s, characterized by its vibrant, glossy, and futuristic aesthetic. Named after the renowned typeface designer Adrian Frutiger, this theme incorporates elements that convey a sense of modernity and high technology.</p>

                <p>There are a few examples of when Frutiger Aero was used. One example is in operating systems: Windows XP and early versions of macOS (like OS X Tiger) showcased elements of the Frutiger Aero style, with their shiny icons, vibrant colors, and 3D effects.</p>

                <p>The second is inspired by the flat design. The flat design is much less "out there" than Frutiger Aero, boasting more contrasting colors being used much more sparingly. </p>

                <p>It also tends to use much simpler typography as well as minimalistic icons, shedding the skin of the over complicated past thematics used. Responsive design also became a norm - a pre-requisite instead of a fancy feature</p>
